The purpose of this project is to create an automated and interactive application that perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning on genomic dataset to find out which snps associate with lactose intolerance.

Part 1: EDA App

Created an automated EDA app that use graphic and statistical summaries to discover patterns and make meaning out of the dataset. By performing EDA, we are able to spot missing data, erroneous data, identify important variables in the dataset, and map the structure of the dataset.

1. Data Preprocessing
a/ Drop rows or columns that contain certain percentage of missing values.
b/ Impute missing value with mean, median, or mode.

2. Visualization
a/ 2D/3D PCA
b/ K-Means Clustering
c/ Hierarchical Clustering

Part 2: Machine Learning App

1. Train/ test split
2. Impute 
3. Models: 
a/ Decision Tree
b/ K nearest neighbors
c/ Random Forest
d/ Support Vector Machine
